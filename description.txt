Flexbox:
The Flexible Box Module, usually referred to as flexbox, was designed as a one-dimensional layout model, and as a method that could offer space distribution between items in an interface and powerful alignment capabilities. 
When we describe flexbox as being one dimensional we are describing the fact that flexbox deals with layout in one dimension at a time — either as a row or as a column. 
There are two axes of flexbox.
1.The main axis:
The main axis is defined by "flex-direction", which has four possible values: row, row-reverse, column, column-reverse. Should you choose row or row-reverse, your main axis will run along the row in the inline direction.
Choose column or column-reverse and your main axis will run from the top of the page to the bottom — in the block directio

2. The cross axis:
The cross axis runs perpendicular to the main axis, therefore if your flex-direction (main axis) is set to row or row-reverse the cross axis runs down the columns.
If flex-direction is set to row then the cross axis runs in the block direction.
If your main axis is column or column-reverse then the cross axis runs along the rows.
If flex-direction is set to column then the cross axis runs in the inline direction.
